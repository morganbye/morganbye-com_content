My horoscope for today.

You Lions have been tested ever since Saturn entered your sign in July, 2005 (<ex-girlfriend> / A levels). Even if you have already been through major transition, your current actions will still have important ramifications over the weeks ahead. Consider the tasks before you; if you are trying to take on too much, you may be forced to let go. Make adjustments now by taking cues from reality before it's too late.

Exams? Career? Yesterday I mentioned to Dom that I was thinking of going into law, he instantly produced a book on just that.
