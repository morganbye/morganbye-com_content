Once again this week I’ve been graced with some wonderful email from UEA’s very own Postgraduate Research Office. These are the people that ultimately will decide whether the university shall award my PhD. No pressure then.

> Dear Morgan I note that you were enrolled on the PPD course “How to write a thesis” (SCI3RE1Y) on 16 December 2010 and did not attend.
>
> Could you please clarify the reason for your non- attendance.
>
> Best Wishes

Now, I know for I fact that I sat through the 3 hours of tedium that was this seminar, all in the name of the government’s insistence on building transferable skills. So I replied

> I did attend. And I did sign in. I’m afraid I don't understand your question.
>
> Morgan

So the next day I had a reply. Oh goody! What could it say, I ponder?

> Dear Morgan

> So sorry the email below was a mistake.
>
> I can see from the attendance list that you did enrol.
>
> Best Wishes
> Anne

Jolly good. I can understand how registers with my signature in the correct box can be confusing.
