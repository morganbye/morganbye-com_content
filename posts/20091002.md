Well I write to you know from the middle of a Maccabees concert. And I've gotta say that I'm completely disappointed. Granted I distance have high hopes of this event. But bloody hell. Get a sound tech. There are no mids and the highs are distorted. Partially from crap speakers, partially from smaller arena echo. Both add up to a better audio experience if one puts their fingers in one ears.
This is actually recommended as it removes the echo from the highs and there's no distortion of the mids.
My biggest gripe of this performance though. And it is pretty significant.
What is this band doing that isn't just the same as "Dogs die in hot cars" or the like 4 years ago.
This genre of magic hasn't evolved. It's the same old sh*t it was 4 years ago. There's a reason that very few people know of Dogs Die in Hot Cars....Because in all honesty they were sh!t 4 years ago.
When will music grow up? Grow up and stop being a sheep? Stop being a sheep and grow an identity?
