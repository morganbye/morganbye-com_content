Well today I've just got back from Lady E's place via the means of a 5 hour train journey.  That I must say was far more productive and pleasant than the train journey to Manchester the week before.  Partially because the train was over half empty and I managed to have a table seat to myself in the Sun with a good book from Sheffield.

The Manchester to Sheffield trip was quite successful in that I only shed only maybe 6 tears upon leaving my lady on a platform.  However, the lady sat next to me at the time was on it like a flash.  Producing all manor of tissues, which was would have been nicer if she wasn't so obviously fishing to see what was up.  But she got off at Sheffield so she need not be palmed off for too long.

But as a whole, despite the bickering, and clear little princess syndrome that goes on in the family, and the crazy impassioned love of the dogs.  I had a really good time in Cornwall with it's glorified garden centres (the eden project), cyder farms, cream teas with views of historic island churches (and explaining clotted cream to Northeners) and Navy sea rescues of people that fall off Land's End.
