Under the new Ubuntu release (11.10 Oneiric Ocelot), trying to run MatLab gets the following error
```
/opt/MATLAB/bin/util/oscheck.sh: 605: /lib64/libc.so.6: not found
```

MatLab will still load, but will effectively be useless and can only be closed by killing the process. Furthermore, my previous trick of
```
sudo ln -s /lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so /lib64/libc.so.6
```

On closer inspection, the `libc.so.6` link exists in `/lib64` however the file it actually points to (`/lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so`) does not exist, thanks to the update it’s moved

## For 64 bit:
Remove old link
```
sudo rm /lib64/libc.so.6
```

(Be careful when removing the old link. It is essential for Linux to boot. So if you reboot before replacing the link with the new version then it’ll be time to dig out a live disk. If you’re paranoid then you can copy `cp` the `libc.so.6` file to something like `libc.so.6.backup` first.)

Replace with new link
```
sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so /lib64/libc.so.6
```

## For 32 bit:
(I have not tested this as I only run x64 systems, but from the comments I think it should work)

Remove old link (again be careful with this command)
```
sudo rm /lib32/libc.so.6
```

Replace with new link
```
sudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so /lib/libc.so.6
```

Of course if this is a fresh Ubuntu install then you probably wont need the rm (remove) command.
