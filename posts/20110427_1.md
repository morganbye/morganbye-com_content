Feature implemented in EPRtoolbox or download now

cw-EPR are useful, but when comparing numerous spectra things can become quite challenging especially when different powers or sample concentrations are used.

By normalising (normalizing by American spelling) spectra, key features instantly become more comparible.

This MATLAB function acts discretely to normalise a cw-EPR spectrum or can be used within a script to act upon many spectra.

Usage:
```
y = cwnorm(y)
```

Normalises matrix y (ie the y axis) between -1 and 1.
```
y = cwnorm(y,100)
```

Normalises matrix y between -100 and 100
```
y = cwnorm(y,'true')
```

Performs a true normalisation of y, between 0 and 1
