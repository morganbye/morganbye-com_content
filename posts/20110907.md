cw-EPR spectra are common place in the lab, but often we report them simple as intensity against magnetic field in Gauss (G) or milli-Tesla (mT). However, in reality what we are actually interested is the frequency independent [g-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-factor_(physics)).

The problem is that the g-factor by definition is a reciprocal scale (ie non linear, non logarithmic, and reverse scale), which causes a nightmare when trying to plot in MATLAB.

For this reason I have created two similar scripts. The first plotgxÂ creates a new figure (such as that shown above)
```
plotgx(magnetic_field , intensity, microwave_frequency)
```

Arrays are used for magnetic field and intensity, and a number for the frequency in GHz, for example:
```
plotgx( x, y , 9.771)
```

If no microwave frequency is stated then the program assumes an X-band experiment at 9.75 GHz.

The second script, add_gx, adds a second g-value x-axis to the current figure (or the most recent figure returned by the gca command) and can be called with or without the microwave frequency.
```
add_gx( 83.2)
```
