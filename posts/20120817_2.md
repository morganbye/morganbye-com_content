This morning on the way to work I got down to the road, plugged in my earphones to my phone and hit play on Spotify. Only for some horrible, tinny, quiet music to come out. It seemed that the phone just simply would not recognise that anything had been plugged in. Something that I confirmed when I got to work and confirmed with a pair of headphones and PC that it was the phone and not the earphones.

Well I'm not having this, so I tear off the back cover

Rip out the battery, SIM and microSD card. Before getting to work on the screws.

Turns out that the two screens in the middle are very small posidrives whilst the 2 visible screws (left side) are a very small 6 sided star drive. Fortunately these aren't very tight, so I just used a small flat head screwdriver.

There were 2 VOID stickers covering the remaining star drive screws. But after 2 and a half hears and buying the phone 2nd hand, I figured the warranty wasn't much good to me at this point.

Next was to lift out the battery bay cover

There's two little snap catches on each side. So get in with the flat head screwdriver. Lifting this also ejects the aerial module on the bottom of the phone.

The headphone jack is on the top PCB with the camera module. To get access to this requires the removal of one more tiny posidrive screw (shown at the very bottom of the above picture).

Once this is free you can pull out the PCB (I did so by the pretty robust camera module). Watch out that you dont lose your power button.

Now you can have a good inspection of the headphone jack from both sides.

I recommend getting in there with a can of compressed air just to blow out all of the pocket debris.

Once you're happy, reassemble the phone in reverse order, turn it on. And Bob's your uncle, my headphone jack is back in business.

Who needs a new phone when you can just dissemble and hack a 3 year old one?
