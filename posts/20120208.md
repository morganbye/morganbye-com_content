The Bruker spectrometers output data by default in the Bruker BES3T format, which whilst being perfectly usable is not recognisable by most operating as standard.

This script was originally written for the benefit of the project students in the lab who wanted to plot their cw EPR data in Excel without going to the trouble of learning how to use MATLAB. Or for going back to the spectrometer and trying to export their data in ASCII format.

Instead, they can call e2a (EPR spectrum "2" ASCII), they are presented with a standard "Open file" window to select the file.  A message box then asks whether they want the converted file put into the same folder or somewhere else, which if selected presents a standard "Save as" window to save elsewhere.

By default files are saved as standard comma seperated value files (*.csv) which are directly readable by Excel / OpenOffice / etc

More advanced users can specify delimiters and other file extensions, for example:
```
E2A = ('path/to/file.DTA',' ', '.txt')
```

Takes the file `file.DTA` and converts it to `file.txt` where values are separated with a space rather than the standard comma

# Syntax
```
E2A
E2A ('path/to/file.DTA')
E2A (delimiter)
E2A ('path/to/file.DTA',delimiter)
E2A ('path/to/file.DTA',delimiter, extension)
E2A ('path/to/file.DTA',delimiter, extension, interval)
```

## Inputs
input1      - The path to a file
input2      - Delimiter is the separator in the file `,` for comma, ` ` for space, `\t` for tab, etc
input3      - Extension is the file format to output eg `.csv` , `.txt`, `.dat`, etc
input4      - Desired magnetic field interval eg `0.2` to use interpolation to give data points every 0.2 Gauss

####  Outputs
output      - a file by default a common separated value file (.csv)

####  Example
```
E2A
```
Standard use, a graphical user interface to select file to convert and where to put it

```
E2A = ('/path/to/file.DTA',' ','.txt')
```
Take the file `file.DTA` and convert it to `file.txt` where values are separated with a space rather than the standard comma
