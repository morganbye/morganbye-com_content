So I was going through an old blog, for the only reason that they emailed me saying I hadn't logged on in 6 months and would close the account if I didn't.  Anyway, I found this old post from June '07.  I'll let you guess who it relates to.

Tis a classic response though.
Why do I have to deal with crazys?
The huge iceberg ones at that.

You're a listener.
That's your first mistake.
Your second mistake is being happy with yourself, so the advice sounds more genuine and good.
The third mistake is having a sense of humour and making people happy due to it.

> Morgan says:
Bugger.
Bloody good analysis though.

Made me chuckle anyway. I like the mental image of iceberg crazies.
