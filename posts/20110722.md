cwPlotter is a tool for the easy opening, analysis, manipulation and plotting of cw EPR data.

With an intuitive user interface, users can quickly create professional looking figures in seconds.

cwPlotter comes as part of the EPRtoolbox or as a direct download
Users can load
- a single file
- a folder of files
- a single file with a third dimension (such as power) (*.YGF file)

They can then manipulate the data using
- an autozeroing function
- a normalization function
- a digital smoothing function, using a moving average
- a smoothing fast Fourier transformation

And view the spectra
- with an automatic or manually selected range
- as a single spectrum (with slider to move between them)
- overlaid on top of each other
- staggered (on x, y or x and y axes)
Â 
Moving the cursor over the graph engages the co-ordinate details boxes which read out the exact intensity, magnetic value and g-value.

From the menu, the figure can then be exported or saved in a variety of common image formats
