Today I've been trying to come up with a nice way of visualising the binding interface between protein-protein or protein-DNA complexes. What follows is a quick little walk-through mostly for my own purposes so that I can remember what I've done in the future.

Download PDB file from [pdb.org](https://pdb.org), here `XXXX` will be your PDB accession code.

Point a terminal window at the download directory
```
cd ~/Downloads
```

Run [CCP4](http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download.php):
```
ncont XYZIN XXXX.pdb >> XXXX.ncont << eof

source A              [or whatever your protein chain is]

target E,F             [or whatever the DNA chains are]

eof
```

This will give us a file `XXXX.ncont` in the Downloads folder which contains all the information about the binding interface

Download the PyMOL script for converting CCP4 (*.cont) files: [ccp4_ncont.py](https://github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo/raw/master/ccp4_ncont.py)

Now in PyMOL, load the CCP4 interuptation script
```
run ~/Downloads/ccp4_ncont.py
```

Load the file using File -> or:
```
load ~/Downloads/XXXX.pdb
```

Manipulate the file to something presentable

<image>

In command line type:
```
ccp4_ncont ~/Downloads/XXXX.ncont, selName1=prot, selName2=DNA
```

This gives us all of the atoms and residues involved in binding as useful objects (right hand side of the Viewer Window)

Now we can visualise things a bit better.
```
select dsDNA, chain E+F
```

This selects chains E and F and creates an object called dsDNA. On this object, hide everything, they we can set about visualising the thing better:
```
show_as cartoon, dsDNA
set cartoon_ring_mode, 3
set cartoon_ring_finder, 1
color green, dsDNA and elem C
```

For other styles see the Pymol wiki

<image>

Now we can work on the protein and show the residues at the binding interface
```
show sticks, prot_res
color gray60, plot_res
```

Or select the object and click C (for Color) then "by element"

And then adjust the Carbon colour to the desired using
```
color gray60, elem C
```

Replacing `gray60` with your chosen colour

Currently we have a pretty good stick diagram, but a delicate ball and stick model looks more professional
```
set stick_radius, 0.1
show spheres, prot_res
set sphere_scale, 0.15
```

So our balls of the ball and stick are now present, but to make these more presentable we need to improve their quality when we render
```
set sphere_quality, 4
set stick_quality, 16
```

As the figure grows in complexity it maybe required to turn ray shadows off
```
set ray_shadow, off
```

I've also recoloured the DNA bases using
```
color green, dsDNA+ elem C
```

Now we can add Van der Waal radii of the key atoms to emphasize the binding interface.
```
show dots, prot_atom
show dots, dna_atom
```


Optimise the viewing angle using:
```
orient dsDNA
```

And then use the mouse-wheel to move the transparency of the background, so that the emphasis is in what want to see and the background does not distort it

Finally, to show the co-factor (here it is Mg, in light green) I show it as a Sphere but as we've changed the spheres for the ball and stick model we need to:
```
alter elem mg, vdw=10.0
rebuild
```

And dont forget to `ray` for pretty pictures
