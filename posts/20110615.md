The amino acid converter (AAconverter) is a small user interface that I've put together for MATLAB that will transform amino acids between the 1 letter or 3 letter representation. Useful for any amount of DNA work.

Simply, type or paste (from the clipboard) in one of the boxes and then press the appropriate arrow. The program will then convert between amino acid codes and then format the original and new sequence into easy to view formats (1 letters into groups of 10, 3 letter into groups of 5).
