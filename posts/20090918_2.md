Thank you Virgin Media for once again proving how crap all of your employees at your call centres are trained on the systems on which they work.

I've received a wonderful letter off a, how would we call them, a "*debt recovery service*" saying that I owe the 46 odd pounds.  This annoys me for several reasons:
 - Being charged £46 - £30 as a cancelation charge (because I didn't give them at least 30 days notice, £16 for the remaining service as I didn't hold the account for a full 12 months (*because they couldn't deliver the stupid service to me when I requested it, instead pissing about for a month*)
- After arguing that the £46 was a bit of a joke, I asked whether I could just pay the amount then and there on the phone.  The guy told me that the cancelation team didn't have access to take payments, it was just easier to leave my direct debit and the money would leave my account like a normal bill at the end of the month.  Did it £uck.
- The letter from the debt collectors spells my name, road name and town name wrong.  Knowing full well that these details are from Virgin Media and I emailed them the details.

Compare:

MORGEN BUYE

~~REDACTED~~ ROAD
DOWNEN ~~REDACTED~~

With my actual details:
MORGAN BYE
~~REDACTED~~ RISE
DOWNHAM ~~REDACTED~~

Virgin Media, to you I say this:

Hire some staff that work in the UK, that can speak English and that can spell, or at the very least know the NATO call signs.  And if they have fingers to type, BONUS!
