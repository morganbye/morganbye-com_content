To those that actually read this thing I find myself apologising again.  The last week has been riddled with problems for the website.

For whatever reason the host decided that it would be a good laugh to have blog.morganbye.net try to redirect to morganbye.net/blog which would be fine if they'd told me in advance so I could have changed the blog settings.

Unfortunately they didn't, so my blog was spread across the 2 addresses, meaning that none of the features worked and I couldn't even log in to save my databases.  Thank god for google cache and a bit of "outside-the-box" thinking.  Hopefully, this should be the end of the problems.  That said I might try and to migrate back to the old blog dot address due to personal taste.  But you know, it may turn out to be more trouble than it's worth.

Fingers crossed
