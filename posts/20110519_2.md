This script loads Bruker EPR files into MATLAB.

The script has been extensively tested with Bruker BES3T files (.DTA/.DSC). Originally it was built for cw-EPR files, but functionality has been added for 3 dimensional cw experiments (.DTA/.DSC/.YGF) and for pulsed experiments such as field swept echoes (FSEs) and Fourier induced decays (FIDs). Functionality for advanced and 3D pulsed experiments such as HYSCORE, ESEEM, ENDOR and PELDOR is more supported.

BrukerRead also supports the older Bruker file format (.spc / .par) still used by the Bruker EMX instruments.

The origin of the script is as a result of removing dependancy upon the EasySpin command eprload. As it remains an additional download, is closed source and has occasionally changed with no warning between EasySpin versions, rendering all scripts relying on it useless.

### Syntax
```
BrukerRead
```

for a graphical user interface to load a file
```
BrukerRead( 'path/to/file/to/open' )
```

command line file selection
```
BrukerRead( 'path/to/file/to/open' , 'plot' )
```

to plot the selected file
```
BrukerRead('plot')
```

this allows you to select a file graphically and automatically show it in a new figure, regardless of your output options.
```
[x , y] = BrukerRead ...
```

load x and y data into arrays x and y
```
[x , y, info] = BrukerRead
```

additionally loads the parameters file into a usable array

BrukerRead is combined with a FOR loop and directory search in theÂ eloader command in the EPR toolbox and is also used in cwViewer and PowerSat
