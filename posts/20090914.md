Well today is week 6, thus day 30 at UEA.  And I gotta say that I'm a bit bored by the whole thing.  Thus far I haven't really done anything that I would consider to be work. Yes, I've built a website and a file server but I'm glad to see that a solid science degree leads to me passing the time by working on IT.  Probably much to the annoyance of JC as I've probably done enough IT stuff to make him seriously jealous; as his supposed IT job is seems to be nothing more than a glorified printer tray refiller and mouse connector.  But heyho I guess you gotta start somewhere.  I just wish that I was doing something a little more productive, that said I'm very much grateful that I've actually got something going on and that I'm being paid even if it is to do very little.  This morning on the news some more predictions have been released saying that even though the recession is technically over unemployment is set to double...again

Anyway, enough of such depressing things.  Lady E was down on the weekend which means that the weekend was largely spent on the sofa with the occasional trip out for food or to the cinema.  But it does mean that I have now watched season 1 of Life on Mars, cos let's face it, what else are you going to do on a Saturday.  And the Italian Grand Prix nicely rounded up Sunday, even if Mr Hamilton was a complete fool and pushing himself too hard for no particular reason.

Although if you want a good giggle we have a new series of Jack Osbourne's Adrenaline Junkies.  This season sees Jack going out with the family.  WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE OZZY BUNGIE OUT OF A HELICOPTER?
