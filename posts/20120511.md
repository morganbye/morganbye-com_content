cwViewer is a tool for the easy opening, analysis, manipulation and plotting of cw EPR data and superceeds the previous function [cwPlotter](http://morganbye.net/eprtoolbox/cwplotter)

With an intuitive user interface, users can quickly create professional looking figures in seconds and export them however they like. Here's a quick demo introducing the basic features:

cwPlotter comes as part of the [EPRtoolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eprtoolbox/files/latest/download) or as a [direct download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eprtoolbox/files/cwViewer/cwViewer-v12.6.zip/download)

Users can quickly load
- a single file
- a folder of files
- a single file with a third dimension (such as power) (*.YGF file)

Manipulate the data using
- an auto-zeroing function
- a normalization function
- a Savitzky-Golay smoothing function
- a digital smoothing function, using a moving average
- a smoothing fast Fourier transformation

View the spectra
- with an automatic or manually selected range
- as a single spectrum (with slider to move between them)
- overlaid on top of each other
- staggered (on x, y or x and y axes)
- plotted against Magnetic Field or g-value

From the menu, the figure can then be exported or saved in a variety of common image formats

### EasySpin Integration
As of [v12.7](http://sourceforge.net/projects/eprtoolbox/files/cwViewer/cwViewer_v12.7.zip/download) cwViewer offers limited [EasySpin](http://easyspin.org) integration. From the window menu select EasySpin fitting

This loads the EasySpin fitting window to the bottom-right of the main cwViewer window

From here you have several EasySpin parameters that you can play with. The EasySpin Fitting window loads with pre-defined parameters for nitroxide spin labels.

When happy with the options click the Fit button and whichever spectra is currently on screen will be fitting in a new window in the usual way for EasySpin.
