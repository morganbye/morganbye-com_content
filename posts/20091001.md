If you're going to make attendance compulsary to your stupid 3 DAY induction program at this bloody university then kindly have the good grace to actually bother turning up to the god forsaken thing. I mean honestly how much can the Dean of Students actually talk about to us.  And if he really is that self loving make him turn up on time so that this 24 hour ordeal doesn't start 45 minutes late.
Alternitivly fill the room with strippers so that this sausage fest will be at least entertained in the interim.
