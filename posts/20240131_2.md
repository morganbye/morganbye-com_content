## Best memories

**Best Surprise**
Axe throwing for my birthday

**Best Meal**
Gourmet, fine-dining steak experience in Mexico. The best steak of my life.

**Coolest New Experience**
Swimming through a limestone cave (cenote)

**Favourite Weekend**
Flying into Vancouver for a long weekend and hanging out with some friends, that I dearly miss and should appreciate more

**Favourite First Meeting**
Many new friends at this year's [SwordPunk](https://www.swordpunk.co.uk/)

**Favourite New City**
Cancun, Mexico. First time in Mexico, first time in Latin America

**Favourite Sports Moment**
Crossing the finish line of this year's Montreal half marathon

**Favourite New Walk**
What's old is new again, but walking the North Norfolk Coast around Blakeney with my parents was pretty special

**Favourite New Friend**
Xavier. Placed together to face a near impossible task at work, he quickly became my work wife and more besides. Now if only the kids could stay _not sick_ for one weekend, we'll have ourselves a nice little place date

**Favourite Day**
Tough one to call. First day of Cancun was pretty special. But best day, I think goes to the first day of SwordPunk. After driving across the country to find a Doug ready with beer and a BBQ surrounded by some picturesque camping. Yeah... that's hard to beat.

**Most Intense Week**
Maybe this last week just gone. Having a client at work ask you what exactly they've spent millions of dollars on is never a great conversation to be had.

On the family front, well we had the week where the little guy had surgery, or the week of atrocities and war being declared in Israel. Definitely not the best week I've ever had.

**Favourite Artist**
By Spotify listens, I think Thrice takes it. By actual connection, I've kept coming back to the post-rock. Namely, [Maybeshewill](https://www.youtube.com/maybeshewillofficial) and [Athletics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI8XTtUBt6g&list=OLAK5uy_kCw1TVq7gTHinkFkujZRIT00PrQUNbYxo)

**Favourite Song**
[Lost - Linkin Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NK_JOkuSVY). There's something about hearing a song recorded 20 years ago, by a man, now long dead, and it still sounds like it came out yesterday.

**Favourite Concert**
A good year for gigs. I managed to get to a lot. Some notable highlights were Bullet for my Valentine, Tool, Thrice. But the hands down best was Avenged Sevenfold supported by Alexisonfire.

**Favourite Quote**
Still hard to beat that old Mike Tyson quote

> “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face”
