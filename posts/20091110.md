So Tuesday.  Tuesday was a long week. And Monday seemed to really be 3 or 4 days.  Not helped by my approach to illness (ie ignore it) is starting to come undone.  By that I mean it has now had a few weeks to manifest itself to a stage where I cant really ignore it any more.  I'm now at the stage where I cant really breath nor will it allow me to fall asleep, which is getting to the point of frustration now after 2 nights.

But ho-hum, work is inevitably going to try its best to see that there shall be no time for sickness.  Because and sit tight now kids, here comes the lesson, people are sh!t and will let you down as soon as you let them.  Basically as soon as you start to rely on anyone for anything then you're opening the door to disaster.  And thus the only way to get around this is to do *everything* yourself. This inevitably means that you become incredibly busy.  And even then nothing is guaranteed if your *E Coli* bugs decide not to grow, for no particular reason other than "we don't feel like it".

And then the icing on one's sublime cake is getting to stay an extra 2 hours after work, not getting home until near 7, listening to someone that still seems to struggle with English some days with a thick accent talk about something that I thought I understood.  But alas no, seemingly not, nothing quite like going to a mandatory lecture on something you thought you knew and coming out the other side more confused than you ever thought was possible.  Especially on a topic that you've been familiar with for the last 6 years.

Bah! People!

In the spirit of equality. I hate you all.
