This script allows for the writing of cw-EPR Bruker BES3T files (.DTA/.DSC) files from MATLAB onto your computer

The script uses a graphical user interface to select file name and location, so minimal user line experience is required.

#### Syntax
```
BRUKERWRITE(x,y)
```
Write arrays x and y out

```
BRUKERWRITE(x,y,'40uM_MTSL')
```
A third string argument can be used to name the spectrum, in this case the spectrum will have the title "40uM_MTSL"

----

This script currently only supports 1 y-axis, though it will be extended at some point to have functionality for multiple spectra (2nd y-axis or z-axis) using the *.YGF extension

----
Implemented in the [EPRtoolbox](http://morganbye.net/eprtoolbox/)
