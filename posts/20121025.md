E2AF or "EPR 2 ASCII folder" is a folder version of E2A, whereby a folder of Bruker EPR files are converted to ASCII data files (readable by any operating system), by default the conversion is to *.csv files (comma separated values). These file formats are easily editable and can be imported into Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice or Origin.

E2AF ('path/to/folder')
E2AF (delimiter)
E2AF ('path/to/file.DTA',delimiter)
E2AF ('path/to/file.DTA',delimiter, extension)
```
