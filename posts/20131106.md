Just a quick post tonight because it’s already half past ten here as a result of my two and a half hour Hebrew class after work. Which has given me a mild information overload based headache, but then my brain was desperately trying to learn as much as it could for a long period of time.

Anyway, most folks will be happy to know that I have now successfully moved from the shoddy temporary accommodation, which rumour-has-it will be shortly demolished, into an actual studio apartment designed to try and con as much money out of foreigners as possible.

So first we have a video from my last night in the temporary accommodation. My actual room is not in the video as I was way through the move and it was a state. That and I had the intention of going back and giving it its own video, but I never got there. I did get a few photos, but my net connection is particularly dodgy tonight so they’ll have to be uploaded another day.

Apologies in advance for the commentary (and the Coldplay but that’s VH1′s fault). It sounded like a good idea at the time. Maybe it’s just because no body likes the sound of their own voice – but I do sound horribly British in it.

And then here’s the new place by comparison. Again. Mainly apologies for the truly awful commentary.
