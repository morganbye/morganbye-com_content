So I know it's a confusing time in life.  I'm a post-grad student.  This makes me a student as far as the government, NUS, taxman, uni, my bank and basically everyone else who is concerned.  And I appriciate that I'm not actually taught only further questionning the actual nature of my student status.  Yes I get paid, and yes health and safety think I can be trusted with a fire extinguisher like an actual person.

However, in the eyes of the world I might be a student.  That is to everyone except the uni's very own sports park.  Who seem to think that I should be a full blown paying member of the public.

Anyone want to explain, for the students by the students?
