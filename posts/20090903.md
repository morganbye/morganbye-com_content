I know it's a sh!tty day, but I'm going to jump on the bandwagon just like everyone else.  The weather is terrible at the moment.  And I think, what with the relatively naff summer that we've already have, it's fair to say there goes the end of the summer.  I've already got the coat out.

But the good news is that my house is water-tight this year, and the wind doesnt ravage it either meaning that I can sleep safe and warm.

However, in JCs absense last night I thought I'd try my hand at a little Left4Dead even if the net still hasnt come to our house yet.  However, once again nVidia wanted to show me the middle finger and just made the computer hang over 20 minutes or whenever the nForce chip felt like.  After 3 attempts, and 1 finding of a Windows disk to restore my startup after a crash broke winloader.exe I gave up and went back to Prison Break season 3.

Ps.  Anyone wanting some light singer/songer rock music, get yourself over to Spotify and lookup A Fine Frenzy.
