This script allows for the loading of cw-EPR Fsc2 files from Jens Törring's (FU Berlin) program Fsc2 into the MATLAB environment for data analysis.

# Syntax
```
FSC2READ
```
When no inputs are selected a "point and click" interface guides the user through selecting a file

```
FSC2READ ('/path/to/file')
```
With an input the script opens the selected file

```
FSC2READ ('/path/to/file','plot')
```
With the second input argument as 'plot' the imported file is displayed automatically as a new figure

```
[x, y] = FSC2READ (...)
```
The loaded file has the magnetic field loaded into 'x' and the intensity into 'y'

```
[x, y, header] = FSC2READ (...)
```
As above the loaded file has x and y fields, but also a string that contains all the header information from the file
