...when I saw the queues on campus this morning I just laughed.  Knowing full well that all those “students” will be standing in line for a good 2 hours just to get to the front of the line to get a flimsy piece of plastic, which they will largely never use except to get into the library, so as I say will largely never use.

Although this is a fantastic method of separating out the Brits from the foreigners.  The foreigners clump together in little huddles and don't fully appreciate or understand the system that is British queuing.  And I love it, the very patient of it all, knowing that nothing at the end of the queue will possibly have been worth the wait, but we still do it in quite desperation.

Viva student life! Start as you mean to go on, with disappointment from day one.  Builds character.
