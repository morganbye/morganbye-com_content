Does anyone want to explain my bowels at the moment? For ease of reading I shall refer to them from now on as if they were a train.

I'm a man of routine.  And that routine involves 815. Always has and that's the way I like it. Special exceptions could be made for things like weekends and strange mornings in which case time 90 minutes from getting up.

So why has my body suddenly decided that saving it up for 3 to 4 days is a good idea.  The 815 is maintained but a 915 follow up service seems to be required, almost immediately the space where the 815 left off.

I blame the changing seasons.
