...is the ability that every day provides the opportunity, and more often than not, allows you to realise what a colossal idiot you are.

And not just about the simple stuff, the every day mundane things like "Where the hell did I leave that?". No science allows you to come to some sudden, sweeping realisations that not only you an idiot today, but in fact you have been being a massive idiot for 2 YEARS.

Which is essentially what I've come to today.

Perhaps an example would be better. Today after much agony I've come to the remember that if you have a pot of water to which you add sugar and salt, then boil off the water what you're left with is sugar and salt. The salt does not just magically disappear away with the water. Nor is it mass-less. So anything you do with that white powder, should consider the possibility that salt is still there.

But no, I've taken by white powder and gone with it for 2 years thinking that this stuff is a bit fishy.
