Recently in the lab we've had some problems thanks to a helpful software update rendering it impossible to connect to a spectrometer. This troubleshooting provides a record of my steps to diagnosing the problem. Hopefully shortening the process in the future. The spectrometer in question is a Bruker ELEXSYS E580/E680 hybrid connected to a HP/Bruker desktop running openSUSE 12.1 x64, with Xepr v2.6b53. You will need super user privileges for almost all of these commands.

If not installed getminicom

```
su -
```

Enter root password.
```
minicom
```

Make sure that the RS232cable is connected from the spectrometers RS1 port of the ACPU board (bottom left) to the PCs RS232 port. By default the serial port should be/dev/ttyS0​if minicom is listening to anything else then change it. Do this by pressing Ctrl+A, O. Select A and change the device to the correct serial port. If you change the port exit minicom and reload it.

Otherwise turn on the spectrometers console (be careful with cooling water supplies, you dont want to burn out your microwave source), and minicomshould jump into life and read out the console's boot process

This error occurred during the Internet boot boot driver!
The OS-9 error code is: #007:025.

Now trying to Reconfigure the boot system.

BOOT SYSTEM RECONFIGURATION


Boot drivers available:

1 - Boot from Teac SCSI floppy drive
2 - Boot from OMTI 5400 SCSI floppy drive
3 - Boot from SCSI hard drive
4 - Boot from SCSI tape drive
5 - Boot from ROM
6 - Boot from network
7 - Boot from VMEbus

The priority of these boot drivers can be set below and will remain
set even when power to your system is turned off. This priority
determines the order that the boot drivers will be selected when your
system is configured to boot automatically. It also determines the
order that they appear in the "boot driver menu" as well.

The current system boot driver priority is: 6

Enter the numbers of the boot drivers in the order
that you want them prioritized. ->
```

​Whereas it should read something like:

```
inetboot: using on-board MB86960 (NICE) MTU=1514

bootp: 0:20:15:1:0:13 broadcasting for server
bootp: recv waiting 50 ticks
GOT BOOTP RESPONSE from server 128.141.250.202!
My IP address will be: 128.141.227.182
My tftp bootfile is: /dd/TFTPBOOT/os9boot
My bootfile size is: 528 (512-byte) blocks
My subnet mask is: 255.255.255.0
<<no timeoffset tag>>
tftp: fetch 528 blocks
tftp: got UDP src=808dcd3d:138 dst=808dffff:138 rewaiting
```

So there is clearly a bootp(boot-strap) or tftp(trivial file transfer protocol) problem.

```
bootp: 0:40:98:0:10:57 broadcasting for server
bootp: got UDP src=00000000:68 dst=ffffffff:67 rewaiting
```

`src=00000000` means that a packet is being sent from a source with no IP address, which is what you'd expect from a spectrometer with no connection when it first boots. Whilst `dst=ffffffff` means that the packet is being sent to a broadcast address - ie anyone.

Check `/etc/services` and see if there are UDP entries for the bootstrap ports. It should look like:

```
bootps 67/tcp # Bootstrap Protocol Server
bootps 67/udp # Bootstrap Protocol Server
bootpc 68/tcp # Bootstrap Protocol Client
bootpc 68/udp # Bootstrap Protocol Client
```

If bootp has been properly installed, note that DHCP uses the same ports.

Now see if the computer can "see" the packets from the spectrometer, in a terminal type

```
tcpdump -G 15 -i eth1 (or whatever the spectrometer port is)
```

This will listen to the port for 15 seconds and report any incoming packets

```
tcpdump: WARNING: eth1: no IPv4 address assigned
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth1, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes

```
This tells us:

1) That no IP address has been assigned

2) That the computer is receiving a request every few seconds

Therefore the problem must be with bootstrap assigning the IP address of the spectrometer.

Let's go take a look at that then
```
nano /etc/bootptab
```

at the top of the file we have:
```
.allOS9P4X :sm=255.255.255.0:td=/:\
:hd=/usr/xepr/AcquisitionServer/OS9/CPU/P4X/BOOTP:\
:bs=auto:hn:bf=os9boot:vm=rfc1084:
.allOS9P4X16MB :sm=255.255.255.0:td=/:\
:hd=/usr/xepr/AcquisitionServer/OS9/CPU/P4X/BOOTP_16MB:\
:bs=auto:hn:bf=os9boot:vm=rfc1084:
```

This gives the OS9 CPU boot locations. These look fine. bf=os9boot causes bootstrap to lookup `bootfile.host` and find the correct address

At the bottom of the file we have:
```
#
# individual hosts
#
E580:tc=.allOS9P4X16MB:ht=ethernet:ha=0x00409800008d:ip=192.168.1.10:
Patternjet:tc=.allTNTPATJET:ht=ethernet:ha=0x0000ad022512:ip=192.168.1.11:
Specjet:tc=.allTNTTSA:ht=ethernet:ha=0x0000ad030512:ip=192.168.1.12:
 ```
Again looks fine. So the `xepr/AcquisitionServer/admin/installServerscript` looked to have worked there.

Next up is to try changing eth1 (spectrometer port) from DHCP IP (dynamic) to static IP namely 192.168.1.1 with 255.255.255.0. This is most easily done in Yast followed by resetting the port and then checking the network connections

```
ifconfig eth1 down
ifconfig eth1 up
ifconfig -a
```
```
eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:15:17:48:04:44
inet addr:192.168.1.1 Bcast:192.168.1.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
inet6 addr: fe80::215:17ff:fe48:444/64 Scope:Link

RX bytes:61370 (59.9 Kb) TX bytes:166712 (162.8 Kb)
Interrupt:17 Memory:f0000000-f0020000
```

`eth1` has clearly now got a network connection!

Rerunning the tcpdump command does not give anything, showing no packages, which is what you'd expect from a connected spectrometer not desperately seeking an IP address.

Now let's try Xepr.

Acquisition > Connect to spectrometer

Nothing. Time out error. Restart the spectrometer and ensure that minicomis still running in a terminal window

No joy. The console can still not find the network.

Try reinstalling Xepr server now that the bootstrap server is correctly installed.

This can be done with the command:
```
./usr/xepr/AcquisitionServer/admin/installServer
```

But make sure the server settings are correct first.

Let's check the files changed by the installer to make sure that the installation was a success.
```
nano /etc/hosts
```

Has a lot of repeat entries in it from multiple attempts at installing the server, this was cleaned this up to:
```
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
127.0.0.2 epr-e680.domain.example.edu epr-e680

```

The other `files/etc/xinetd.d/bootps/etc/xinetd.d/tftp` and `/etc/exports` all look as you would expect. Check `/usr/xepr/AcquisitionServer/OS9/Servers/E580/Spectrometer.ini` to check that the settings have been copied across.

Reboot the PC. Open minicom again and turn on the spectrometer.

This looks like a successful console boot. Open Xepr and try to connect to the spectrometer. Success!

----
Additionally, I forgot to mention, it's worth going into Yast > Firewall and changing the port on which the spectrometer is connected to an "Internal" zone, thereby allowing all traffic on all ports. If security is a priority and there is not a direct connection between PC and spectrometer then ports for bootp and tftp will need to be opened.
